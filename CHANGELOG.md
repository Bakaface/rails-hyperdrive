## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Dropped the `< 8.1` upper cap on the `railties` and `activerecord` runtime
  dependencies — both are now floor-only (`>= 7.2`), so the gem installs against
  Rails 8.1 and later without waiting on a new release. The gem uses only stable
  public Rails APIs and degrades gracefully per-tool, so the cap was conservative
  rather than load-bearing. CI now exercises Rails 8.1 in place of 8.0.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- `hyperdrive:discover` — read-only, networked command that suggests uninstalled
  `rails-hyperdrive-*` companion gems for the app's stack. Queries the rubygems
  search API, matches each companion's declared `hyperdrive_targets` against
  `Gemfile.lock`, and prints the `bundle add` lines to run. Results cache to
  `.hyperdrive/discover_cache.json` (24h TTL; `--refresh` busts it); offline or
  rate-limited runs fall back to a stale cache or report "unavailable" without
  failing. Ships dormant — returns nothing until companion gems exist on rubygems.
- `hyperdrive:init` now adds a `.gitignore` rule for the discover cache.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- Initial release of `rails-hyperdrive`: a dev-only Rails engine that mounts an MCP
  server at `/_hyperdrive/mcp` exposing introspection tools for AI coding agents.
- `hyperdrive:init` generator that installs architecture skills and auto-discovers
  per-gem skills.
